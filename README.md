# onlyplaywithstreamers
This Plugin disallows 'normal' Players to grief or to do other stupid stuff. They get kicked when a Streamer lefts.
And some other additionally Rules and Systems has been added meanwhile:
- ArenaPVP
- Staff-Commands
- Heaven (When a Player dies, he'll be teleported to a place of peace to await the countdown to be finished.)
